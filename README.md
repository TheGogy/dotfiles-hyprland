# dotfiles-hyprland
A collection of my dotfiles for the Hyprland compositor for Wayland. Some of it looks kinda cool I guess.
Sorry about not making this a bit more official looking, this is more of a place for me to store all this if I want to get this working on another device, and to share the files with my friends.
